般若波罗蜜多心经  (玄奘译本)

> 观自在菩萨，行深般若波罗蜜多时，照见五蕴皆空，度一切苦厄。
> 舍利子，色不异空，空不异色，色即是空，空即是色，受想行识，亦复如是。
> 舍利子，是诸法空相，不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不减。
> 是故空中无色，无受想行识，无眼耳鼻舌身意，无色声香味触法，无眼界乃至无意识界，无无明亦无无明尽，乃至无老死，亦无老死尽，无苦集灭道，无智亦无得。
> 以无所得故，菩提萨埵，依般若波罗蜜多故，心无挂碍；无挂碍故，无有恐怖，远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅槃。
> 三世诸佛依般若波罗蜜多故，得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。
> 故知般若波罗蜜多，是大神咒，是大明咒，是无上咒，是无等等咒，能除一切苦，真实不虚。
> 故说般若波罗蜜多咒，即说咒曰：揭谛揭谛　波罗揭谛　波罗僧揭谛　菩提萨婆诃。
