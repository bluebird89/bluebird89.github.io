般若波罗蜜多心经  (玄奘译本)

> 观自在菩萨，行深般若波罗蜜多时，照见五蕴皆空，度一切苦厄。
> 舍利子，色不异空，空不异色，色即是空，空即是色，受想行识，亦复如是。
> 舍利子，是诸法空相，不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不减。
> 是故空中无色，无受想行识，无眼耳鼻舌身意，无色声香味触法，无眼界乃至无意识界，无无明亦无无明尽，乃至无老死，亦无老死尽，无苦集灭道，无智亦无得。
> 以无所得故，菩提萨埵，依般若波罗蜜多故，心无挂碍；无挂碍故，无有恐怖，远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅槃。
> 三世诸佛依般若波罗蜜多故，得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。
> 故知般若波罗蜜多，是大神咒，是大明咒，是无上咒，是无等等咒，能除一切苦，真实不虚。
> 故说般若波罗蜜多咒，即说咒曰：揭谛揭谛　波罗揭谛　波罗僧揭谛　菩提萨婆诃。

> 我想擦去一切不幸
> 我想在大地上
> 画满窗子
> 让所有习惯黑暗的眼睛都习惯光明

《我曾经七次鄙视自己的灵魂 》 卡里·纪伯伦

> 第一次，当它本可进取时，却故作谦卑
> 第二次，当它在空虚时，用爱欲来填充
> 第三次，在困难和容易之间，它选择了容易
> 第四次，它犯了错，却借由别人也会犯错来宽慰自己
> 第五次，它自由软弱，却把它认为是生命的坚韧
> 第六次，当它鄙夷一张丑恶的嘴脸时，却不知那正是自己面具中的一副；
> 第七次，它侧身于生活的污泥中，虽不甘心，却又畏首畏尾。

> Seven times I have despised my soul:
> The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.
> The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.
> The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.
> The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.
> The fifth time when she forbode for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.
> The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.
> And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.
