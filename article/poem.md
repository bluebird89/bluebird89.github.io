## 《班扎古鲁白玛的沉默》 作品集《疑似风月》 作者：扎西拉姆·多多

```
你见，或者不见我 我就在那里 不悲 不喜
你念，或者不念我 情就在那里 不来 不去
你爱，或者不爱我 爱就在那里 不增 不减
你跟，或者不跟我 我的手就在你手里 不舍 不弃
来我的怀里 或者 让我住进你的心里 默然 相爱 寂静 欢喜
```


```
拟挽歌词 陶渊明

荒草何茫茫，白杨亦萧萧。严霜九月中，送我出远郊。

幽室一已闭，千年不复朝。千年不复朝，贤达无奈何。
向来相送人，各自还其家。 亲戚或余悲，他人亦已歌。
死去何所道，托体同山阿

《离亭宴》
“俺曾见金陵玉殿莺啼晓，秦淮水榭花开早。
谁知道容易冰消！ 眼看他起朱楼，眼看他宴宾客，眼看他楼塌了！ ”

《辛夷坞》
“木末芙蓉花，山中发红萼。 涧户寂无人，纷纷开且落。 ”

荣木
采采荣木，结根于兹。晨耀其华，夕已丧之。
采采荣木，于兹托根。 繁华朝起，慨暮不存。

李白《夏日山中》
“懒摇白羽扇，裸体青林中。 脱巾挂石壁，露顶洒松风。 ”

李商隐 《昨夜》
“不辞鶗鴂妒年芳，但惜流尘暗烛房。 昨夜西池凉露满，桂花吹断月中香。 ”

王维的《南垞》
“轻舟南垞去，北垞淼难即。
隔浦望人家，遥遥不相识。 ”

叶芝有一首诗叫做《随时间而来的真理》：
“穿过我青春所有说谎的日子，我在阳光下抖掉我的枝条和花朵。 我现在可以枯萎而进入真理。 ”

## 给你 文/余秀华

```
一家朴素的茶馆， 面前目光朴素的你皆为我喜欢
你的胡子，昨夜辗转的面色让我忧伤
我想带给你的，一路已经丢失得差不多
除了窗外凋谢的春色
遇见你以后，你不停地爱别人，一个接一个
我没有资格吃醋，只能一次次逃亡
所以一直活着，是为等你年暮
等人群散尽，等你灵魂的火焰变为灰烬
我爱你。我想抱着你
抱你在人世里被销蚀的肉体
我原谅你为了她们一次次伤害我

因为我爱你
我也有过欲望的盛年， 有过身心俱裂的许多夜晚

但是我从未放逐过自己
我要我的身体和心一样干净
尽管这样，并不是为了见到你

I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to "glorify God and enjoy him forever."

Henry David Thoreau:Walden,or Life in the Woods

我到林中去，因为我希望谨慎地生活，只面对生活的基本事实，看看我是否学得到生活要教育我的东西，免得到了临死的时候，才发现我根本就没有生活过。我不希望度过非生活的生活，生活是那样的可爱；我却也不愿意去修行过隐逸的生活，除非是万不得已。我要生活得深深地把生命的精髓都吸到，要生活得稳稳当当，生活得斯巴达式的，以便根除一切非生活的东西，划出一块刈割的面积来，细细地刈割或修剪，把生活压缩到一个角隅里去，把它缩小到最低的条件中，如果它被证明是卑微的，那么就把那真正的卑微全部认识到，并把它的卑微之处公布于世界；或者，如果它是崇高的，就用切身的经历来体会它，在我下一次远游时，也可以作出一个真实的报道。因为，我看，大多数人还确定不了他们的生活是属于魔鬼的，还是属于上帝的呢，然而又多少有点轻率地下了判断，认为人生的主要目标是“归荣耀于神，并永远从神那里得到喜悦”。

## O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!

```
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;

But O heart! heart! heart!
O the bleeding drops of red,
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up&emdash;for you the flag is flung&emdash;for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths&emdash;for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
Here Captain! dear father!
The arm beneath your head!
It is some dream that on the deck,
You've fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won:
Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
But I with mournful tread,
Walk the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.
```

## THE ROAD NOT TAKEN ROBERT FROST(1874-1963)

```
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler,long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other,as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim;
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that,the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh,I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence;
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,and I—
I took the less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
```

## Sonnet 18 William Shakespeare

```
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
```

## She Walks In Beauty George Gorden Byron

```
She walks in beauty,like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellow’d to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more,one ray the less,
Had half impair’d the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er he face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure,how dear their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek,and o’er that brow,
So soft,so calm,yet eloquent,
The smiles thatv win,the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!
```

我想写一个故事
一个只关于你和我的故事
开始
于某年某月的那个点头微笑
枫叶羞红了脸
不经意 洒了几缕阳光
剧情被时间斟得满满当当
平凡 但不平淡
简单 却也揪心
早在一开始就注定的结局里
终于逃不开樊笼
败给了光年
我也走了 悄悄把门关上
月亮怎么也留不住自己的影子
结束
在某年某月的一个微笑表情
我想写一个故事
一个只留给我和你的故事
```

## 卜算子·黄州定慧院寓居作 苏轼

```
缺月挂疏桐，漏断人初静。
时见幽人独往来，缥缈孤鸿影。
惊起却回头，有恨无人省。
拣尽寒枝不肯栖，寂寞沙洲冷。
```

## 过零丁洋 文天祥

```
辛苦遭逢起一经，干戈寥落四周星。
山河破碎风飘絮，身世浮沉雨打萍。
惶恐滩头说惶恐，零丁洋里叹零丁。
人生自古谁无死，留取丹青照汗青！
```


```
生命如同走夜路
灵魂/觉知就是光照
事实上往哪走并不重要
人都喜欢够亮的地方

更深的觉知是可以选择往哪照
而我关了灯坐下
心念似已走遍大千

知道言语后面成长/社会/演化的因缘
见多了时下针孔里群雄并起的精彩
放开乾坤大，也不怜草木青
就什么都不做
什么人的悲喜也不响应
已是筋疲力尽
```
