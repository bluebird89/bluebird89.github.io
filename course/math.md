## 基础

* [数学思维导论 Introduction to Mathematical Thinking]( Introduction to Mathematical Thinking):Learn how to think the way mathematicians do – a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years. Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

* 弧度是角的度量单位。它是由国际单位制导出的单位，单位缩写是rad。定义：弧长等于半径的弧，其所对的圆心角为1弧度.根据定义，一周的弧度数为2πr/r=2π，360°角=2π弧度，因此，1弧度约为57.3°，即57°17'44.806''，1°为π/180弧度，近似值为0.01745弧度，周角为2π弧度，平角（即180°角）为π弧度，直角为π/2弧度。

## 机器学习

* [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization（面向机器学习的数学专项课程系列）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-specializations-mathematics-machine-learning):For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in maths – stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialisation aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying maths, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science. In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them. The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimise fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting. The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Components Analysis, uses the maths from the first two courses to do simple optimisation for the situation where you don’t have an understanding of how the data variables relate to each other. At the end of this specialisation you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.
  - [Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra（面向机器学习的数学：线性代数）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-linear-algebra-machine-learning):vectors and matrices. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them, including the knotty problem of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and how to use these to solve problems. Finally we look at how to use these to do fun things with datasets – like how to rotate images of faces and how to extract eigenvectors to look at how the Pagerank algorithm works. Since we’re aiming at data-driven applications, we’ll be implementing some of these ideas in code, not just on pencil and paper. Towards the end of the course, you’ll write code blocks and encounter Jupyter notebooks in Python, but don’t worry, these will be quite short, focussed on the concepts, and will guide you through if you’ve not coded before. At the end of this course you will have an intuitive understanding of vectors and matrices that will help you bridge the gap into linear algebra problems, and how to apply these concepts to machine learning.
  - [Mathematics for Machine Learning: Multivariate Calculus（面向机器学习的数学：多变量微积分）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-multivariate-calculus-machine-learning):This course offers a brief introduction to the multivariate calculus required to build many common machine learning techniques. We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the “rise over run” formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck. Hopefully, without going into too much detail, you’ll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future.
  - [Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA（面向机器学习的数学：主成分分析）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-pca-machine-learning):This course introduces the mathematical foundations to derive Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a fundamental dimensionality reduction technique. We’ll cover some basic statistics of data sets, such as mean values and variances, we’ll compute distances and angles between vectors using inner products and derive orthogonal projections of data onto lower-dimensional subspaces. Using all these tools, we’ll then derive PCA as a method that minimizes the average squared reconstruction error between data points and their reconstruction. At the end of this course, you’ll be familiar with important mathematical concepts and you can implement PCA all by yourself. If you’re struggling, you’ll find a set of jupyter notebooks that will allow you to explore properties of the techniques and walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If you are already an expert, this course may refresh some of your knowledge.
