* 弧度是角的度量单位。它是由国际单位制导出的单位，单位缩写是rad。定义：弧长等于半径的弧，其所对的圆心角为1弧度.根据定义，一周的弧度数为2πr/r=2π，360°角=2π弧度，因此，1弧度约为57.3°，即57°17'44.806''，1°为π/180弧度，近似值为0.01745弧度，周角为2π弧度，平角（即180°角）为π弧度，直角为π/2弧度

## 基础

* 数学思维导论 Introduction to Mathematical Thinking:Learn how to think the way mathematicians do – a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years. Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

## 微积分 Calculus

* [Pre-Calculus: Functions（初级微积分：函数）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-pre-calculus):This course covers mathematical topics in college algebra, with an emphasis on functions. The course is designed to help prepare students to enroll for a first semester course in single variable calculus. Upon completing this course, you will be able to: 1. Solve linear and quadratic equations 2. Solve some classes of rational and radical equations 3. Graph polynomial, rational, piece-wise, exponential and logarithmic functions 4. Find integer roots of polynomial equations 5. Solve exponential and logarithm equations 6. Understand the inverse relations between exponential and logarithm equations 7. Compute values of exponential and logarithm expressions using basic properties
* [Pre-Calculus: Trigonometry(初级微积分：三角）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-trigonometry):This course covers mathematical topics in trigonometry. Trigonometry is the study of triangle angles and lengths, but trigonometric functions have far reaching applications beyond simple studies of triangles. This course is designed to help prepare students to enroll for a first semester course in single variable calculus. Upon completing this course, you will be able to: 1. Evaluate trigonometric functions using the unit circle and right triangle approaches 2. Solve trigonometric equations 3. Verify trigonometric identities 4. Prove and use basic trigonometric identities. 5. Manipulate trigonometric expressions using standard identities 6. Solve right triangles 7. Apply the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines
* [Calculus: Single Variable Part 1 – Functions（单变量微积分1：函数）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-single-variable-calculus):Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and 4) a clear, dynamic, unified approach. In this first part–part one of five–you will extend your understanding of Taylor series, review limits, learn the *why* behind l’Hopital’s rule, and, most importantly, learn a new language for describing growth and decay of functions: the BIG O.
* [Calculus: Single Variable Part 2 – Differentiation（单变量微积分2：微分）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-differentiation-calculus):Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and 4) a clear, dynamic, unified approach. In this second part–part two of five–we cover derivatives, differentiation rules, linearization, higher derivatives, optimization, differentials, and differentiation operators.
* [Calculus: Single Variable Part 3 – Integration（单变量微积分3：积分）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-integration-calculus):Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and 4) a clear, dynamic, unified approach. In this third part–part three of five–we cover integrating differential equations, techniques of integration, the fundamental theorem of integral calculus, and difficult integrals.
* [Calculus: Single Variable Part 4 – Applications（单变量微积分4：应用）](http://coursegraph.com/coursera-applications-calculus):Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences.

* 数学的故事 The Story of Maths (2008)
  - 数学是研究数量、结构、变化以及空间模型等概念的一门学科。透过抽象化和逻辑推理的使用，由计数、计算、量度和对物体形状及运动的观察中产生。数学家们拓展这些概念，为了公式化新的猜想以及从合适选定的公理及定义中建立起严谨推导出的真理。
