* the meanings of life 香港中文大学人类学主任 麦高登
  - 低端全球化
    + 交易风险较大，属于法律盲区，多以现金流通为主，不需要信用证、信用卡等凭证，都是以信任而非合同为基础。
    + 世界上绝大部分人都在经历低端全球化。全球化不仅仅在美国、中国、日本、欧洲进行，不是，全球化的浪潮横扫了全球，而低端全球化正是世界上大部分人所经历的。中国在低端全球化中扮演了非常关键的角色，
    + 山寨产品就是那些拿了苹果手机，或者三星手机的设计，按照他们的设计生产出外观一样的手机，却贴着自己品牌的手机，这就是中国低端制造。
    + 正是因为假货和山寨品，把全球化的产品带到了发展中地区，否则那些人将无法享受全球化的成果。中国使得物资全球化得以实现，尽管有些商品是仿造的。
  - 在这个世界上我们必须学会，不要过分关注别人从哪里来。不管别人的国家贫穷还是富有，这都不重要，重要的是每个人都是我们其中的一员。
  - 工作最终是不适合作为生活的意义的，异化是我们生活的一部分。大多数情况下，我们都不热爱我们的工作，工作是因为必须，而不是想做。
  - 以家庭作为生活的意义也很脆弱。在婚姻伴侣的选择上，人们常常做出错误的决定。
  - 生活意味着什么，以及应该如何生活
    + 相信所有你可以相信的意义。我不是说你应该成为宗教信徒，但是如果你认为你的生活有目的，你的生活可能会好过一点。如果你认为我们只是动物，生活毫无意义，那么想要拥有幸福的生活是有点困难的。
    + 生活本身是美好的。只要你活着，你就可以感受到手臂上拂过的风，感受到阳光，感受到你对他人的爱意，享受它们就好了。但另一方面，社会是疯狂的。社会教给你的很多事，比如什么是成功，什么是好的生活，大多都不是真的。记住，你需要对社会保持怀疑。 从这一点出发，尽可能做出明智的选择。这听起来就像常识一样简单，但很多人并没有这样做，特别是那些关于工作和爱的选择。尽可能找到自己热爱的事情，或者至少是喜欢的事情。找到能够完全接受你的伴侣，找到那个让你变好的人，不只是找到浪漫的爱情。
    + 我们活着不是为了荣誉，而是为了那些时刻。当你临终的时候，你会想到那些和爱人一起度过的愉快时光，你们听着雨声，感到十分美妙的时刻；你会想到爬山的时候，仰着头看到日出的时刻；你会想到你的孩子对你说，妈妈我爱你。重要的是生活的每个片刻，这就是生活的意义所在。
  - 我们为什么活着：个人与社会。需要记住这一点：个体生活意义的重要组成部分，比如工作、家庭、后代、名声、创造力、宗教等等，它们的存在不只是为了满足你的个人需求，它们还满足了社会的需求。这些是社会想让我们相信和遵守的东西，也是我们获得价值观的途径。
    + 为什么社会想要愚弄我们呢？很简单，社会需要生产、再生产以及对社会准则的信任，只有这样才能使社会具有合理性。
      * 因为个体都从社会中寻求自我意义，也就不由自主遵循这些意义去生活，社会提供了更多宽泛的意义， 爱 金钱 国家，我们照单全收，社会传递的价值观强烈的塑造着我们
    + 社会在操纵我们，社会欺骗了我们
      * 一位日本朋友，他一心想成为公司的最高管理层，然后他成功地达成了目标。可是六个月后他突发心脏病去世了。他的妻子对我说，他干嘛要那么拼命呢？他活着的时候，工作就是他的全部。可是他为什么要这样啊？如果他知道自己的结局，也许就会换个活法了。他如此拼命的原因是他被社会愚弄了，他听信了社会的话：要想成功就必须这么做。他相信了，他死了。然后呢？他和别人并没有什么两样。这就是我们很多人被影响和塑造的方式。我和你们一样，深陷在这社会的陷阱中。没有人能幸免于难。
      * 社会告诉了我们很多讯息，但我们完全可以不遵守，过自己的生活。你们是自由的，这就是在现代社会中生活的益处。这一点很重要，你们并不是选择的奴隶。过适合你自己的、经过审视的生活
      * 生活中的互相虚张声势，两个人互相彼此撒谎，对双方彼此都有益
      * 如果你能意识到你在如何生活，并且能尽可能地保持清醒，你就很大程度上可以逃脱这种愚弄。一定要记住，我们比我们想象的要自由。
      * 996盛行、房价高居不下、个体被社会完全吞并裹挟、都市病日益加剧的今天，日复一日在遮天蔽日的写字楼里见不到阳光的人们似乎才是应该有所反思的一方
    + 我们为什么活着：历史与进化
      * 每天的生活方式：名人崇拜、无休止的消费和工作、战争、环境污染。回到狩猎采集社会
      * 生活在一个广阔的城市，可我们不了解任何人。我们所生活的世界里没有这类友谊，但狩猎者们有。他们的社会里没有抑郁，也不会有殴打儿童的事情发生，这是今天的社会才有的事。所以，在一个不协调或者不快乐的世界里，应该如何寻找生命的意义？
      * 我们是宇宙的神经末梢，我不仅仅是以个人身份扮演自我的角色，我是宇宙本身，因为我创造了宇宙。我是宇宙的眼细胞、耳细胞、脑细胞。这是一个很酷的信念，甚至有一点傲慢。 我喜欢看月亮，看彩虹，仅仅是因为我正在看它，我正在看由我组成的东西。我希望我死去，让骨灰在自然中散落，回到自然中。

## 《30岁不是一个新的20岁》

* 人生真正的大机会都是在35岁左右发生的，如果你浪费了二十多岁时的大好时光，就必须在三十岁的前五年同时完成结婚、家庭、事业、生子这几件大事，你的生活一定很狼狈，这就是在为你二十多岁时“享受年轻”支付高利贷
* 经营婚姻（work on your marriage）最好的时机是在结婚前，那就是积极地去恋爱
* 婚姻像民主，不是什么好东西，但却是我们目前所能找到的最好的东西。

## 告别辞 乔治·华盛顿

```
如果一个政府力量过弱，经不住朋党派系之争，不能使社会每一分子守法，不能维持全体人民安全而平静地享受其人身和财产权利，那么，这个政府只是徒有虚名而已。

我已经提醒你们，在美国存在着党派分立的危险，并特别提到按地域差别来分立党派的危险。现在让我从更全面的角度，以最严肃的态度概略地告诫你们警惕党派思想的恶劣影响。

不幸的是，这种思想与我们的本性是不可分割的，并扎根于人类脑海里最强烈的欲望之中。它以各种不同的形式存在于所有政府机构里，尽管多少受到抑制、控制或约束。但那些常见的党派的形式，往往是最令人讨厌的，并且确实是政府最危险的敌人。

它往往干扰公众会议的进行，并削弱行政管理能力。它在民众中引起无根据的猜忌和莫须有的惊恐；挑拨派系对立；有时还煽起骚动和叛乱。它为外国影响和腐蚀打开方便之门。外国影响和腐蚀可以轻易地通过派系倾向的渠道深入到政府机构中来。这样，一个国家的政策和意志就会受到另一个国家政策和意志的影响。

有一种意见，认为自由国家中的政党，是对政府施政的有效牵制，有助于发扬自由精神。在某种限度内，这大概是对的；在君主制的政府下，人民基于爱国心，对于政党精神即使不加袒护，亦会颇为宽容。但在民主性质的纯属选任的政府下，这种精神是不应予以鼓励的。从其自然趋势看来，可以肯定，在每一种有益的目标上总是不乏这种精神的。但这种精神常有趋于过度的危险，因此应当用舆论的力量使之减轻及缓和。它是一团火，我们不要熄灭它，但要一致警惕，以防它火焰大发，变成不是供人取暖，而是贻害于人。

还有一项同样重要的事，就是一个自由国家的思想习惯，应当做到使那些负责行政的人保持警惕，把各自的权力局限于宪法规定的范围内，在行使一个部门的权力时，应避免侵犯别一个部门的权限。这种越权精神倾向于把所有各部门的权力集中于某一部门，因而造成一种真正的专制主义，姑不论其政府的形式如何……如果民意认为，宪法上的权限之分配或修改，在某方面是不对的，我们应当照宪法所规定的办法予以修改。但我们不可用篡权的方式予以更改；因为这种方法，可能在某一件事上是有效的手段，但自由政府也常会被这种手段毁灭。所以使用这种方法，有时虽然可以得到局部的或一时的好处，但此例一开，一定抵不过它所引起的永久性危害的。

在导致昌明政治的各种精神意识和风俗习惯中，宗教和道德不可缺少的支柱。一个竭力破坏人类幸福的伟大支柱——人类与公民职责的最坚强支柱——的人，却妄想别人赞他爱国，必然是白费心机的。政治家应当同虔诚的人一样，尊敬和爱护宗教与道德。宗教与道德同个人福利以及公共福利的关系，即使写一本书也说不完。我们只要简单地问，如果宗教责任感不存在于法院赖以调查事件的宣誓中，那么，哪能谈得上财产、名誉和生命的安全呢？而且我们也不可耽于幻想，以为道德可不靠宗教而维持下去。高尚的教育，对于特殊构造的心灵，尽管可能有所影响，但根据理智和经验，不容许我们期望，在排除宗教原则的情况下，道德观念仍能普遍存在。

有一句话大体上是不错的，那就是：道德是民意所归的政府所必需的原动力。这条准则可或多或少地适用于每一种类型的自由政府。凡是自由政府的忠实朋友，对于足以动摇它组织基础的企图，谁能熟视无睹呢？因此，请大家把普遍传播知识的机构当作最重要的目标来加以充实提高。政府组织给舆论以力量，舆论也应相应地表现得更有见地，这是很重要的。

## David Foster Wallace - Commencement Speech at Kenyon College

```
(If anybody feels like perspiring, I’d advise you to go ahead, because I’m sure going to. In fact I’m gonna [mumbles while pulling up his gown and taking out a handkerchief from his pocket].) Greetings [“parents”?] and congratulations to Kenyon’s graduating class of 2005.
（如果你感觉热的汗都要下来了，我建议你就让汗水尽情流淌吧，反正我打算这么干了。实际上，我要 [喃喃着撩起学士服，掏出手绢 ]。 欢迎 [*各位家长们*？]，并且祝贺 Kenyon 05 界毕业生们。

There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”
有两条年轻的鱼迎面遇到一条老鱼。老鱼点头打招呼道 “早上好呀，孩子们。这水怎么样？“ 两条年轻的鱼继续游了一会儿，终于其中一条忍不住看看另一条说道 ”什么他妈的是‘水’呀？“

This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story [“thing”] turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you’re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don’t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.
美国大学毕业典礼演讲标准的开场通常是一个富于教育意义的小故事。这种故事比起毕业典礼上常见的说教，算是不那么扯淡的。但是请不要以为我视自己为这条老而智慧的鱼，来向你们这些小鱼儿传道什么是水。这个故事只是想说：最明显、最重要的现实往往最不易被察觉或讨论的。当然，这么说出来也只是老生常谈。但是事实是，成年人日复一日的生活中，老生常谈确是关乎生死。这就是我想在这个爽快美好的早晨于你们分享的一点想法。

Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I’m supposed to talk about your liberal arts education’s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff.
当然这类演讲的主要目的在于我应该给你们讲讲博雅教育（译者：即 liberal arts education) 的意义，给你们解释，为何你们-+马上要拿到的学位有着实在的人本价值，而非仅仅物质上的回报。

So let’s talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about quote teaching you how to think.
所以我们来聊聊毕业典礼模式中最常见的陈词滥调，即是人文教育不应该是填充知识，而是所谓的教你如何思考。

If you’re like me as a student, you’ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think.
如果你像当年的我，你听这个就烦了，你觉得让别人来教你如何思考的实在是有点耻辱。因为你已经进入到了这么好的大学，它似乎证明了你已经懂得如何思考。

 But I’m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we’re supposed to get in a place like this isn’t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I’d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.
 但是我想要预设，博雅教育（译者注：liberal arts education, 也称文理教育、通识教育）的陈词滥调丝毫不具有侮辱性，因为我们应该在这样一个地方（译者：指大学）所获得的真正关于思考的重要的教育，并非关于思考的能力，而是关于思考内容的选择。如果你觉得你自己显而易见有完全的自有去选择思考什么，以致于讨论它就是浪费时间，我会想要让你琢磨一下鱼和水的故事，并且在接下来几分钟时间里，先搁置你对于浪费时间讨论这么明显事情的质疑。

Here’s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: “Look, it’s not like I don’t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It’s not like I haven’t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn’t see a thing, and it was fifty below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out ‘Oh, God, if there is a God, I’m lost in this blizzard, and I’m gonna die if you don’t help me.’” And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. “Well then you must believe now,” he says, “After all, here you are, alive.” The atheist just rolls his eyes. “No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.”
再讲个小寓言故事。两个男人在遥远的阿拉斯加的荒野酒吧喝酒。一个是很虔诚的信教者,另一个是无神论者,俩人在讨论上帝的存在。酒过三巡，讨论气氛开始紧张。无神论者说:听着，我不是无缘无故不信神。而是我没经历过上帝啊祈祷之类的事。上个月我被一场暴风雪困住,我完全迷路了,看不见任何东西。温度低于五十五（译者：指华氏）, 所以我试着跪下祈祷说,上帝,如果你真的存在,帮帮我,不然我就要死了。然后那个教徒迷惑的看着无神论者说,那你应该已经确信了啊。你现在好端端坐在这呢。无神论者说:靠！最后全靠一群爱斯基摩人凑巧在闲逛发现了我然后帮我指明了路。

It’s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people’s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy’s interpretation is true and the other guy’s is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person’s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language.
用博雅教育的传统来分析这个故事并不难：对不同的人来说，完全相同的经历会有截然不同的体验，前提是这两人在两种不同的信仰模式下，会用两种不同的方式构建经验。我们鼓励信仰之间的包容和信仰的多样性，所以在分析中我们并不是想说其中一人的理解是对的，而另一个的是错的或是不好的。这很好地方。仿佛我们认为一个人面对世界最基本的认知，他对他的人生经验的看法，某种程度，但是我们就没机会探究这些人们的思考模式和信仰的根本来源。也就是说，这来自两个人心里的上的潜移默化,就像他的身高和脚码、是与生俱来的；或者，像是语言的学习一样来自周围文化。

As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there’s the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They’re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists’ problem is exactly the same as the story’s unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up.
好比我们怎样构建意义不是个人的、刻意的选择。而是，这还有关狂妄。那个无神论者是如此确信爱斯基摩人的出现和他的祈祷毫无关系。当然，很多信教的人也很狂妄，对自己的认识坚信不疑。他们可能比无神论者更让人讨厌。但是宗教卫道士们的问题跟这个故事中的无神论者是一样的：盲目自信，封闭的思想，其等同于一个彻底的监狱以至于被监禁之人都不知道自己在监狱之中。

The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.
我就是想说，这就是所谓的教会我如何思考。少一点目中无人的狂妄。多一点有关自己和自己信念的批判性的自我意识。因为很多我不假思索就确信的事情，最终是彻底错误的。学会这一点的过程并不容易,我相信对于你们也是如此。

Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe; the realist, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centeredness because it’s so socially repulsive. But it’s pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people’s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.
有个例子可以证明我不假思索就确认的东西是大错特错的：我从经验判断，我是宇宙的绝对中心，我是现存最真实，最鲜明的人。我们很少会花时间思考这种自我为中心的念头，因为这太过令人讨厌。但另一方面我们所有人都是这样的。这是我们的默认设置，一出生就接入了我们体内。想想吧：你所经历过的一切体验中，你都是其绝对中心。你所接触的世界是“你”面前的，身后的，在“你”左右的。它在“你”的电视上或显示器里等等。别人的思维和感受都与你沟通，而你自己才是最直接，最紧急，最真实的。

Please don’t worry that I’m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It’s a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being “well-adjusted”, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.
请不要担心，我不准备向你布道什么是同情、什么是他人导向或者什么是所谓的美德。这不关美德什么事儿。这关系到我怎样以某种方式改变或者得到自我天性的解放，自身有种硬性的默认的设置让自己潜意识的以自我为中心，并以自己的视界去解读每个东西。那些能够调整自己这种本能的认知方式的人会被看做“良好调整的”，我要说明的是，这并不是个随随便便就命名的术语。

Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education — least in my own case — is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualize stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.
根据权威的学术见解，问题是显而易见的，即如何去调整自身的认识包括根据实际的情况和或者自己的理解。这个问题非常棘手。也许最危险的就是学术教育本身。至少我是这样的。学术教育可以把我培养成一个出色的脑袋，使我沉溺于抽象理论的世界，而并非简单的关注前方，往何处走，关注自己的内心。

As I’m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.
我想你们这现在已经意识到，保持警惕和集中注意力是非常困难的，我们很容易就会被大脑中不断进行着的自我思考给催眠了（也许你现在就在这样做）。在我大学毕业后的20年以来，我渐渐了解到尽管“教会你如何思考”这个概念已经被讨论博雅教育的人们说滥了，但是当你意识到接下来的这个更深一层的解读后，你会发现人们其实低估了这个概念的重要性：“学会如何思考”的真正意义是学会如何控制你每时每刻在思考什么、以及如何思考，这意味着你要能够保持清醒的意识，去选择将思考的注意力放在什么上，并从自己经历的事中获取意义。因为作为一个成年人，如果你不能这样控制你自己的思维，你就完了。还记得那句老话吗——大脑可以成为一个出色的仆人，但同时也可以成为糟糕的的主宰。

This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.
就像许多陈词滥调一般，这个表面上看起来表意不明，平平无奇的事情其实表明了一个伟大而可怕的事实。用枪支自杀的成人瞄准的总是自己的头，这并不是一个巧合。他们把自身可怖的主宰给射杀了。而真相其实是在他们早在扣动扳机之前就已经“死”了。

And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let’s get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what “day in day out” really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine, and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I’m talking about.
我承认，你所接受的博雅教育其真实而非扯淡的价值就在于此：如何防止你度过舒适、顺遂、体面的成人生活时死气沉沉、无知无觉、仆从于你的大脑以及被默认设置为日复一日地独特、彻底、帝王般地独行。 这或许听像夸大其词，或者抽象的废话。我们来说点实在的。简单的事实就是，你们这些毕业生对“日复一日”真正意味着什么还一点门没摸着。美国成人生活里整整巨大的部分在大学毕业演讲中从没被提起。其中一个部分跟无聊、柴米油盐和无厘头的沮丧有关。在场的家长们和年长的人都太清楚我在讲些什么。

By way of example, let’s say it’s an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you’re tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there’s no food at home. You haven’t had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It’s the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, th e supermarket is very crowded, because of course it’s the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it’s pretty much the last place you want to be but you can’t just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store’s confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to maneuver your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren’t enough check-out lanes open even though it’s the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can’t take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.
举个例子，就说这是个成人平常的一天。你早早起床，去到充满挑战的应届生白领工作，努力工作了8到10个小时。一天结束后你累了，压力有点大，于是你只想回家吃碗热汤饭，有时间的话放松1小时，然后早早上床。因为你第二天又得早起，度过相同的一天。但是之后你想起家里没吃的了。因为工作繁忙你这周还没来得及买菜，于是下班后现在你还得开车去超市。工作日结束了（是下班高峰），堵车自然是：一塌糊涂。你花了比平常长得多的时间去超市，当你好不容易到了，超市非常拥挤，因为别的上班族当然也在一天中的这个时候挤点时间买菜。

But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line’s front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to “Have a nice day” in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.
但是不管怎样，你最终还是来到了收银台的最前端，为事物付完账，然后被一种毫无疑问如同死亡之音的声音祝福到“祝您一天愉快”。接下来你不得不把那些令人毛骨悚然的，脆弱的，塑料袋装的食品扔进只有一个轮子的令人抓狂的推车中，向左挤过拥挤的，坑坑洼洼乱七八糟的停车场，然后回家路上永远充斥着缓慢、沉重、密密麻麻SUV、交通高峰，等等等等。

Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn’t yet been part of you graduates’ actual life routine, day after week after month after year.
But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I’m gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it’s going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.
在场的人肯定都有过类似的经历，但是这还没有成为你们这些毕业生日复一日年复一年的柴米油盐，但是这种日子离你们不远了。而且还有会变得更枯燥的、烦人的、不确定的、无意义的平淡生活。但这不是重点。重点是，刚刚一堆打击你们的糟糕的生活场景正是发挥选择作用的地方。因为，拥堵的交通、熙攘的街道、长长队伍的收银口给了我思考的时间。如果我不能利用这些时间理智地做出决定去思考去关心一些有意义的事情，那么每次购物我都会发疯。我明白人生中遇到的这些事情都是上天注定的。我渴望回家，那些在大街上和我擦肩而过的路人也不都是这么想的么？这些人都是什么样的人？看看这些在收银口排队的人们：他们大部分看起来让你厌恶，蠢蠢的体型硕大，眼中没有一丝生气。有些则不懂规矩让人讨厌，在队伍中央大声讲电话。瞧瞧这些是多么的让人觉得不平。

Or, of course, if I’m in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV’s and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, forty-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest [responding here to loud applause] (this is an example of how NOT to think, though) most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children’s children will despise us for wasting all the future’s fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.
又或者，如果我存在于自身具有社会意识的自由艺术形态中，我能将时间耗费在下班时期当中，被那些巨大的、呆蠢的、堵路的烧着它们自私的、浪费的四十加仑的汽油SUV、悍马以及V-12皮卡所恶心，并且我也能接受那些长得奇丑的司机开的在汽车保险杠上贴着爱国或者有宗教意义贴纸这种事实[回应大家的掌声](虽然这也是一个不去思考的例子)，让人厌恶的汽车，被长相奇异、不考虑他人、易动肝火的人开着。我也能想象出我们孩子的孩子将会对我们浪费他们的能源表露出的的失望，也有可能我们还弄糟了全球的气温。我们是如此的自私、愚蠢、讨人嫌，现代文明下的消费者是如此的糟糕。

You get the idea.
你明白了吧。

If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn’t have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It’s the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I’m operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world’s priorities.
如果我选择了在商店里或高速公路上用这种方式来考虑问题，那很好。我们中的很多人会这么想。这么想虽然非常简单且自然，但是并不是必然的选择。这是我默认的自然形态。这种自然的想法，使我在自发且无意识地相信自己是世界的中心时，经历了成人生活的枯燥，沮丧和拥塞那部分。并且，使我紧接下来的需求和感觉是，想知道什么才是决定这个世界的先决条件。

The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it’s not impossible that some of these people in SUV’s have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he’s trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he’s in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.
当然，事实是，总会有完全不同的思路去考虑不同的情形。在交通中，所有的停在或者闲逛挡在我的路上的车辆，有可能有一部分开SUV的人过去曾经经历过严重车祸，他们觉得开车是一件非常恐怖的事情，以至于他们的（心理）医生为了使他们开车时有安全感，劝说他们弄一辆庞大且笨重的SUV。或者，刚才是一位父亲开的Hummer越线超车，因为他要送他旁边座位生病或者受伤的孩子去医院。因此他是在这种更合理的急迫条件下才需要开得比我快：实际上是我挡了他的路。

Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket’s checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.
要么我可以强迫自个儿去考虑这种可能性：每个在超级市场收银台前排队的都和我一样无聊沮丧，甚至有些人过的日子比我更艰难、更繁琐、更痛苦。

Again, please don’t think that I’m giving you moral advice, or that I’m saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it’s hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won’t be able to do it, or you just flat out won’t want to.
再次地，请不要觉得我是在给你们什么道德上的建议，或者觉得我是再说你们应该这么想，或者觉得有人在期待你这么做。因为这很难。这样做需要决心和努力。如果你和我一样坚持，总会有一天你会坚持不了，或者你会感到疲惫而放弃。


But most days, if you’re aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she’s not usually like this. Maybe she’s been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it’s also not impossible. It just depends what you what to consider. If you’re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won’t consider possibilities that aren’t annoying and miserable. B ut if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.
但是大多数时候，假如你足够清醒给自己一个机会，你可以选择试着用另外一种眼光重新审视一下这位肥胖的、眼睛无神的、画了浓妆、对着自己小孩大喊大叫排在收银队伍中的这位妇女。也许她平常不是这样。也许她连续三个晚上陪在罹患骨癌的丈夫病床旁边，紧紧的握着他的手。也许这个女士是汽车销售处拿着低薪的店员，昨天你的妻子还靠着她的官腔解决了一个令人恐怖、手续繁缛的让人大怒的问题。当然，这些都没有相似之处，但是也不见得不可能。这仅仅取决于你怎么考虑。假如你很自然的认为就是这么滴，并且你天生就会这么想，那么你就像我一样，大概不会考虑这些可能性一点都不神奇或者让人厌烦。但是如果你真的学会了怎么去关心，那么你会发现其实还有其他的选择。这其实也会增强你的能力让你体验一个拥挤、闷热、缓慢、极度消费的境况，并且这不光光有意义，而且神圣，就如同创造星星的力量一样让你全身火热：博爱、友谊、所有事物最深层次的神秘根源（oneness，统一性，意译了一下好接下文）(学习了！)。

Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that’s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you’re gonna try to see it.
This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn’t. You get to decide what to worship.
这神秘的根源并不一定是真实的。唯一真实的东西是，你会决定你自己怎么去尝试看到它。因此我主张，这才是真正学习如何良好地适应环境所带来的自由。你自己有意识地决定哪些东西有意义而哪些没有。你自己决定信仰什么。

Because here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to day of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship — be it JC or Allah, bet it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles — is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.
因为这还有其他古怪但是真实的东西：在日复一日成年人生活的“战壕”中，并没有所谓的美学。没有所谓的不信仰。每个人都有自己的信仰。唯一可以选择的是信仰什么。也许，选择某些类似上帝或者精神上的事物来信仰的有说服力的原因是——无论你选择JC（耶稣）还是Allah（阿拉真主）,或者我打赌它是YHWH（以色列某个时代的上帝）或威卡教的圣母，或者说是四圣谛，或者其他的不可违背的道德准则——如果你选择其他的东西来信仰的话你会被吞掉。如果你信仰金钱或者具体的事物，如果你真的把你的信仰放在那上面的话，那么你永远不会有足够的钱或其他东西，你永远不会觉得满足。这就是事实。（如果）信仰你的身体，你的美貌，你的性吸引力，你永远都会觉得你很丑。而且，当时光和岁月开始展示力量时，在哀悼（失去他们）之前你就已经死了一百万次。在某个层面上，我们都知道了这些道理。这些道理已经被编纂成神话故事，谚语，陈词滥调，警句，寓言了；这已经成为了每个美好故事的骨架。因此总的秘诀是把事实摆在日常觉悟之上。
哇晒！鼓掌鼓掌

Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings.
崇拜权力，最终会让你感到无力和恐惧，你将需要更多凌驾于他人的权力来麻醉自己的恐惧。
自视聪明，并让自己看上去很聪明，你最终将感到自己的愚蠢，谎言最终总会被识破。可是这些崇拜的隐患并非因为他们是邪恶或者有罪，他们只是无意识的，来自于惯性。

They’re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that’s what you’re doing.
你将逐渐陷入这样的崇拜之中，日复一日，越来越有选择的去看和判断价值，而无视你所做的事情。

And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving and [unintelligible — sounds like “displayal”]. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.
这所谓的真实的世界，并不阻碍你惯性思维去处事。因为所谓的真实世界中的人、金钱和权力都源自一种来自自己的恐惧、愤怒、沮丧、渴望和崇拜。我们当今的文化把这些力量演变成了过度的财富、舒适和个人自由。这些自由成为了我们这个不大的国家的主人，成为了一切创造的唯一核心。当然他们有很多理由可以称道，不过，也还有其他一些类型的自由，而这些，是之前你很少听到过的，外界世界需要、实现并(听上去不太合理)展现它们。这真正重要的自由包括了关注、认识和自律，每天，会真正去关心他人，在无数的琐碎、无趣的事情上贡献出自己的力量


That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.
这是真正的自由。这是受过教育，并且明白怎样去思考。反面即无意识，惯性思维，你死我活的竞争，对得到和失去永恒的痛苦，这些无限的事情。

I know that this stuff probably doesn’t sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don’t just dismiss it as just some finger-wagging Dr. Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death.
我知道，可能这些听上去并不有趣、令人愉快，也没有一个毕业演讲该有的那样启迪心灵。就我看，它只关于大写的T，即实在，而去掉了一大堆华丽的词藻。当然，你怎样想是你的自由。但是，请不要无视它，仅仅晃晃手指(Dr. Laura sermon?)。这些跟美德、信仰、信条或者死后的任何重大问题都无关。

The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.
大写的T，即实在，关乎的是生前的事。

It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:
关于的是真正的教育中真正的价值，几乎跟知识毫无关系，仅仅是简单的常识，明白什么是真实的和必要的，他们无形的隐藏在我们周围，无时无刻。我们需要做的，就是不断的提醒自己，

“This is water.”

It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.
想保持清醒，在成人的世界中日日夜夜的生活会有超乎想象的艰难。这意味着，另外一句老话也是对的：教育实际上是一辈子的事，它始于当下。

I wish you way more than luck.

Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, and Distinguished Members of the Congress:
I stand on this rostrum with a sense of deep humility and great pride -- humility in the weight of those great American architects of our history who have stood here before me; pride in the reflection that this home of legislative debate represents human liberty in the purest form yet devised. Here are centered the hopes and aspirations and faith of the entire human race. I do not stand here as advocate for any partisan cause, for the issues are fundamental and reach quite beyond the realm of partisan consideration. They must be resolved on the highest plane of national interest if our course is to prove sound and our future protected. I trust, therefore, that you will do me the justice of receiving that which I have to say as solely expressing the considered viewpoint of a fellow American.
I address you with neither rancor nor bitterness in the fading twilight of life, with but one purpose in mind: to serve my country. The issues are global and so interlocked that to consider the problems of one sector, oblivious to those of another, is but to court disaster for the whole. While Asia is commonly referred to as the Gateway to Europe, it is no less true that Europe is the Gateway to Asia, and the broad influence of the one cannot fail to have its impact upon the other. There are those who claim our strength is inadequate to protect on both fronts, that we cannot divide our effort. I can think of no greater expression of defeatism. If a potential enemy can divide his strength on two fronts, it is for us to counter his effort. The Communist threat is a global one. Its successful advance in one sector threatens the destruction of every other sector. You can not appease or otherwise surrender to communism in Asia without simultaneously undermining our efforts to halt its advance in Europe.
Beyond pointing out these general truisms, I shall confine my discussion to the general areas of Asia. Before one may objectively assess the situation now existing there, he must comprehend something of Asia's past and the revolutionary changes which have marked her course up to the present. Long exploited by the so-called colonial powers, with little opportunity to achieve any degree of social justice, individual dignity, or a higher standard of life such as guided our own noble administration in the Philippines, the peoples of Asia found their opportunity in the war just past to throw off the shackles of colonialism and now see the dawn of new opportunity, a heretofore unfelt dignity, and the self-respect of political freedom.
Mustering half of the earth's population, and 60 percent of its natural resources these peoples are rapidly consolidating a new force, both moral and material, with which to raise the living standard and erect adaptations of the design of modern progress to their own distinct cultural environments. Whether one adheres to the concept of colonization or not, this is the direction of Asian progress and it may not be stopped. It is a corollary to the shift of the world economic frontiers as the whole epicenter of world affairs rotates back toward the area whence it started.
In this situation, it becomes vital that our own country orient its policies in consonance with this basic evolutionary condition rather than pursue a course blind to the reality that the colonial era is now past and the Asian peoples covet the right to shape their own free destiny. What they seek now is friendly guidance, understanding, and support -- not imperious direction -- the dignity of equality and not the shame of subjugation. Their pre-war standard of life, pitifully low, is infinitely lower now in the devastation left in war's wake. World ideologies play little part in Asian thinking and are little understood. What the peoples strive for is the opportunity for a little more food in their stomachs, a little better clothing on their backs, a little firmer roof over their heads, and the realization of the normal nationalist urge for political freedom. These political-social conditions have but an indirect bearing upon our own national security, but do form a backdrop to contemporary planning which must be thoughtfully considered if we are to avoid the pitfalls of unrealism.
Of more direct and immediately bearing upon our national security are the changes wrought in the strategic potential of the Pacific Ocean in the course of the past war. Prior thereto the western strategic frontier of the United States lay on the literal line of the Americas, with an exposed island salient extending out through Hawaii, Midway, and Guam to the Philippines. That salient proved not an outpost of strength but an avenue of weakness along which the enemy could and did attack.
The Pacific was a potential area of advance for any predatory force intent upon striking at the bordering land areas. All this was changed by our Pacific victory. Our strategic frontier then shifted to embrace the entire Pacific Ocean, which became a vast moat to protect us as long as we held it. Indeed, it acts as a protective shield for all of the Americas and all free lands of the Pacific Ocean area. We control it to the shores of Asia by a chain of islands extending in an arc from the Aleutians to the Mariannas held by us and our free allies. From this island chain we can dominate with sea and air power every Asiatic port from Vladivostok to Singapore -- with sea and air power every port, as I said, from Vladivostok to Singapore -- and prevent any hostile movement into the Pacific.
Any predatory attack from Asia must be an amphibious effort.* No amphibious force can be successful without control of the sea lanes and the air over those lanes in its avenue of advance. With naval and air supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases, any major attack from continental Asia toward us or our friends in the Pacific would be doomed to failure.
Under such conditions, the Pacific no longer represents menacing avenues of approach for a prospective invader. It assumes, instead, the friendly aspect of a peaceful lake. Our line of defense is a natural one and can be maintained with a minimum of military effort and expense. It envisions no attack against anyone, nor does it provide the bastions essential for offensive operations, but properly maintained, would be an invincible defense against aggression. The holding of this literal defense line in the western Pacific is entirely dependent upon holding all segments thereof; for any major breach of that line by an unfriendly power would render vulnerable to determined attack every other major segment.
This is a military estimate as to which I have yet to find a military leader who will take exception. For that reason, I have strongly recommended in the past, as a matter of militaryurgency, that under no circumstances must Formosa fall under Communist control. Such an eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the Philippines and the loss of Japan and might well force our western frontier back to the coast of California, Oregon and Washington.
To understand the changes which now appear upon the Chinese mainland, one must understand the changes in Chinese character and culture over the past 50 years. China, up to 50 years ago, was completely non-homogenous, being compartmented into groups divided against each other. The war-making tendency was almost non-existent, as they still followed the tenets of the Confucian ideal of pacifist culture. At the turn of the century, under the regime of Chang Tso Lin, efforts toward greater homogeneity produced the start of a nationalist urge. This was further and more successfully developed under the leadership of Chiang Kai-Shek, but has been brought to its greatest fruition under the present regime to the point that it has now taken on the character of a united nationalism of increasingly dominant, aggressive tendencies.
Through these past 50 years the Chinese people have thus become militarized in their concepts and in their ideals. They now constitute excellent soldiers, with competent staffs and commanders. This has produced a new and dominant power in Asia, which, for its own purposes, is allied with Soviet Russia but which in its own concepts and methods has become aggressively imperialistic, with a lust for expansion and increased power normal to this type of imperialism.
There is little of the ideological concept either one way or another in the Chinese make-up. The standard of living is so low and the capital accumulation has been so thoroughly dissipated by war that the masses are desperate and eager to follow any leadership which seems to promise the alleviation of local stringencies.
I have from the beginning believed that the Chinese Communists' support of the North Koreans was the dominant one. Their interests are, at present, parallel with those of the Soviet. But I believe that the aggressiveness recently displayed not only in Korea but also in Indo-China and Tibet and pointing potentially toward the South reflects predominantly the same lust for the expansion of power which has animated every would-be conqueror since the beginning of time.
The Japanese people, since the war, have undergone the greatest reformation recorded in modern history. With a commendable will, eagerness to learn, and marked capacity to understand, they have, from the ashes left in war's wake, erected in Japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity; and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality, freedom of economic enterprise, and social justice.
Politically, economically, and socially Japan is now abreast of many free nations of the earth and will not again fail the universal trust. That it may be counted upon to wield a profoundly beneficial influence over the course of events in Asia is attested by the magnificent manner in which the Japanese people have met the recent challenge of war, unrest, and confusion surrounding them from the outside and checked communism within their own frontiers without the slightest slackening in their forward progress. I sent all four of our occupation divisions to the Korean battlefront without the slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon Japan. The results fully justified my faith. I know of no nation more serene, orderly, and industrious, nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future constructive service in the advance of the human race.
Of our former ward, the Philippines, we can look forward in confidence that the existing unrest will be corrected and a strong and healthy nation will grow in the longer aftermath of war's terrible destructiveness. We must be patient and understanding and never fail them -- as in our hour of need, they did not fail us. A Christian nation, the Philippines stand as a mighty bulwark of Christianity in the Far East, and its capacity for high moral leadership in Asia is unlimited.
On Formosa, the government of the Republic of China has had the opportunity to refute by action much of the malicious gossip which so undermined the strength of its leadership on the Chinese mainland. The Formosan people are receiving a just and enlightened administration with majority representation on the organs of government, and politically, economically, and socially they appear to be advancing along sound and constructive lines.
With this brief insight into the surrounding areas, I now turn to the Korean conflict. While I was not consulted prior to the President's decision to intervene in support of the Republic of Korea, that decision from a military standpoint, proved a sound one, as we hurled back the invader and decimated his forces. Our victory was complete, and our objectives within reach, when Red China intervened with numerically superior ground forces.
This created a new war and an entirely new situation, a situation not contemplated when our forces were committed against the North Korean invaders; a situation which called for new decisions in the diplomatic sphere to permit the realistic adjustment of military strategy.
Such decisions have not been forthcoming.
While no man in his right mind would advocate sending our ground forces into continental China, and such was never given a thought, the new situation did urgently demand a drastic revision of strategic planning if our political aim was to defeat this new enemy as we had defeated the old.
Apart from the military need, as I saw It, to neutralize the sanctuary protection given the enemy north of the Yalu, I felt that military necessity in the conduct of the war made necessary: first the intensification of our economic blockade against China; two the imposition of a naval blockade against the China coast; three removal of restrictions on air reconnaissance of China's coastal areas and of Manchuria; four removal of restrictions on the forces of the Republic of China on Formosa, with logistical support to contribute to their effective operations against the common enemy.
For entertaining these views, all professionally designed to support our forces committed to Korea and bring hostilities to an end with the least possible delay and at a saving of countless American and allied lives, I have been severely criticized in lay circles, principally abroad, despite my understanding that from a military standpoint the above views have been fully shared in the past by practically every military leader concerned with the Korean campaign, including our own Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I called for reinforcements but was informed that reinforcements were not available. I made clear that if not permitted to destroy the enemy built-up bases north of the Yalu, if not permitted to utilize the friendly Chinese Force of some 600,000 men on Formosa, if not permitted to blockade the China coast to prevent the Chinese Reds from getting succor from without, and if there were to be no hope of major reinforcements, the position of the command from the military standpoint forbade victory.
We could hold in Korea by constant maneuver and in an approximate area where our supply line advantages were in balance with the supply line disadvantages of the enemy, but we could hope at best for only an indecisive campaign with its terrible and constant attrition upon our forces if the enemy utilized its full military potential. I have constantly called for the new political decisions essential to a solution.
Efforts have been made to distort my position. It has been said, in effect, that I was a warmonger. Nothing could be further from the truth. I know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to me is more revolting. I have long advocated its complete abolition, as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a means of settling international disputes. Indeed, on the second day of September, nineteen hundred and forty-five, just following the surrender of the Japanese nation on the Battleship Missouri, I formally cautioned as follows:
"Men since the beginning of time have sought peace. Various methods through the ages have been attempted to devise an international process to prevent or settle disputes between nations. From the very
start workable methods were found in so far as individual citizens were concerned, but the mechanics of an instrumentality of larger international scope have never
been successful. Military alliances,balances of power, Leagues of Nations,
all in turn failed, leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war. The utter destructiveness of war now blocks out this alternative. We have had our last chance. If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system,Armageddon will be at our door. The problem basically is theological and involves a spiritual recrudescence and improvement of human character that will synchronize with our almost matchless advances in science, art, literature, and all material and cultural developments of the past 2000 ears. It must be of the spirit if we are to save the flesh."
But once war is forced upon us, there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end.
War's very object is victory, not prolonged indecision.
In war there is no substitute for victory.
There are some who, for varying reasons, would appease Red China. They are blind to history's clear lesson, for history teaches with unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war. It points to no single instance where this end has justified that means, where appeasement has led to more than a sham peace. Like blackmail, it lays the basis for new and successively greater demands until, as in blackmail, violence becomes the only other alternative.
"Why," my soldiers asked of me, "surrender military advantages to an enemy in the field?" I could not answer.
Some may say: to avoid spread of the conflict into an all-out war with China; others, to avoid Soviet intervention. Neither explanation seems valid, for China is already engaging with the maximum power it can commit, and the Soviet will not necessarily mesh its actions with our moves. Like a cobra, any new enemy will more likely strike whenever it feels that the relativity in military or other potential is in its favor on a world-wide basis.
The tragedy of Korea is further heightened by the fact that its military action is confined to its territorial limits. It condemns that nation, which it is our purpose to save, to suffer the devastating impact of full naval and air bombardment while the enemy's sanctuaries are fully protected from such attack and devastation.
Of the nations of the world, Korea alone, up to now, is the sole one which has risked its all against communism. The magnificence of the courage and fortitude of the Korean people defies description.
They have chosen to risk death rather than slavery. Their last words to me were: "Don't scuttle the Pacific!"
I have just left your fighting sons in Korea. They have met all tests there, and I can report to you without reservation that they are splendid in every way.
It was my constant effort to preserve them and end this savage conflict honorably and with the least loss of time and a minimum sacrifice of life. Its growing bloodshed has caused me the deepest anguish and anxiety.
Those gallant men will remain often in my thoughts and in my prayers always.
I am closing my 52 years of military service. When I joined the Army, even before the turn of the century, it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams. The world has turned over many times since I took the oath on the plain at West Point, and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished, but I still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that "old soldiers never die; they just fade away."
And like the old soldier of that ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty.
Good Bye.

总统先生、议长先生和尊敬的国会议员们：
我怀着十分谦卑而又骄傲的心情站在这演讲台上。 我谦卑，是因为在我之前，许多美国历史上伟大的建设者们都曾经在这里发过言；我骄傲，是因为今天我们的立法辩论代表了经深思的人类解放最纯粹形式。这是整个人类进程中的希望、热情和信仰的集中体现。我并不是作为任何一个党派的拥护者站在这里讲话的，因为这些问题太重要，以至都超越了党派的界线。如果要证实我们的动机是正确的，如果要保障我们的将来，制定关于国家利益的最高纲领时就必须考虑到它们。我相信，当我说完我仅仅是为了陈述经深思熟虑而得出的一个普通美国公民的观点之后，你们会公平地接受它。在我生命将逝之年做这个告别演说，无仇无怨。在我心中只有一个目的：为我的祖国服务。
这些问题是全球性的，而且环环相扣，任何的顾此失彼做法都会使整体造成灾难。亚洲被普遍认为是通往欧洲的门户，同样的，欧洲也是通往亚洲的大门，二者是息息相关的。有人认为我们的力量不足以同时保住两个阵地，因为我们不能分散我们的力量。我想，这是我听到的最悲观的失败主义论调了。如果我们潜在的敌人能够把他的力量分在两条线上，那我们就必须与之抗衡……
除了指出这些一般常识外，我将把讨论集中在亚洲地区。在客观地估计那里的现状之前，我们必须了解亚洲的过去，了解导致她上升到今天这种局势的革命性的变化。长期遭受殖民主义势力的剥削而使亚洲人民没有机会获取任何程度的社会平等、个人尊严，也无法提高生活水平，就像被我们的菲律宾贵族政府所统治的那样。亚洲人民在战争中找到了机会，得以摆脱殖民主义的枷锁，而且有更多的新的契机摆在他们面前：政治独立带来的以前从未感受过的尊严和自重。亚洲有占世界一半的人口和百分之六十的自然资源，她的人民正迅速地加强一个新兴的力量，包括精神和物质两方面，藉此提高他们的生活水平，协调现代化的进步和他们特有的文化环境。不管你是不是坚持殖民主义的观点，这是亚洲前进的方向，她不会停步。这一点是世界经济防线转移、国际事务中心回归原点的必然结果。在这种情况下，我们国家在政治上必须与基本的革命形势一致，而不能无视殖民时代已经过时，且亚洲人民渴望开创自己的自由生活的现实，这一点十分重要。他们需要的是友好的指引、理解和支持，而不是专制的指挥。
我坚持保全他们，并希望能用最少的时间、最小的牺牲体面地结束这场野蛮的冲突。越来越多的流血让我感到深深的痛苦和焦虑。那些勇敢的人的形象在我的脑海中挥之不去，我将永远为他们祈祷。
我将结束我五十二年的军旅生涯。我在世纪之交之前就已加入军队，它满足了我孩童时所有的希望和梦想。自从我在西点的草坪上宣读誓言以来，这个世界已经经历了多次转变，童年的希望和梦想早已消失得无影无踪。但我依然记得当年那首流行的军歌中骄傲的叠句：一个老兵永不死亡，他只是淡出舞台。就像歌中的老兵一样，我结束我的军旅生涯，只是淡出了人生舞台。一个力图像上帝指引的那样完成他的责任的老兵。再见
