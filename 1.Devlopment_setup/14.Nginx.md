	location  / {
	  # matches any query, since all queries begin with /, but regular
	  # expressions and any longer conventional blocks will be
	  # matched first.
	  [ configuration B ] 
	}
	location /documents/ {
	  # matches any query beginning with /documents/ and continues searching,
	  # so regular expressions will be checked. This will be matched only if
	  # regular expressions don't find a match.
	  [ configuration C ] 
	}
	location ^~ /images/ {
	  # matches any query beginning with /images/ and halts searching,
	  # so regular expressions will not be checked.
	  [ configuration D ] 
	}
	location ~* \.(gif|jpg|jpeg)$ {
	  # matches any request ending in gif, jpg, or jpeg. However, all
	  # requests to the /images/ directory will be handled by
	  # Configuration D.
