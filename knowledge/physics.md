# Physics

## Introductory Mechanics

* University Physics with Modern Physics by Young and Freedman (essential). Work through all of the "Mechanics" chapters (in my edition, these are chapters 1-14). This is the best introductory book I've found, and you can use it when you learn electrostatics and modern physics, too. It contains plenty of great example problems to work through, and the solutions are easy to find online. It does a great job of introducing the relevant mathematics, but you'll need to be learning calculus alongside it. You don't need to spend $250 on the new edition - Amazon has lots of copies of the 12th edition and the 13th edition that contain the same material.
* Thomas' Calculus
* Calculus: Early Transcendentals

## Electrostatics

## Waves and Vibrations

* Vibrations and Waves by French (essential) and Vibrations and Waves by King (essential). These two books complement each other very well, and contain different problems and solutions.
* Advanced Engineering Mathematics

## Modern Physics

## Classical Mechanics

* Taylor's Classical Mechanics (essential). This is a fantastic introduction to classical mechanics.
* Morin's Introduction to Classical Mechanics with Problems and Solutions (supplement). Morin's book is a good supplement to Taylor's, and contains some great problems to work through.
* Problems and Solutions in Introductory Mechanics by Morin (supplement). Even more great problems (with solutions) to work through, and contains some great problem-solving strategies.
* Kibble's Classical Mechanics (supplement). Another great book to supplement Taylor.
* A Student's Guide to Lagrangians and Hamiltonians (supplement). This book can help you a lot if you get stuck on understanding the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of classical mechanics. You need to master the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms if you want to understand quantum mechanics later on!

## Electrodynamics

* Griffith's Introduction to Electrodynamics (essential). This is the book on undergraduate electrodynamics, and one of the very best physics textbooks ever written. Take great care to work through every single problem in the book.
* Div, Grad, Curl and All That by Schey (supplement). This is a short textbook on vector calculus that is very helpful when trying to work with vectors in electrodynamics.
* A Student's Guide to Maxwell's Equations by Fleisch (supplement). Maxwell's equations are essential in understanding electrodynamics, and this book is the best supplement on the topic.

## Quantum Mechanics

## Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics

## Advanced Electives in Physics

* Astronomy: The Cosmic Perspective by Bennet and Donahue. A wonderful, fun, well-written introduction to astronomy that can be understood by anyone who has studied the first topic in undergraduate physics (Introductory Mechanics).
* Astrophysics: An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics by Carroll and Ostile. A super comprehensive introduction to modern astrophysics for students who are studying the undergraduate curriculum in physics.
* Cosmology: Ryden's Introduction to Cosmology. My favorite introductory cosmology book!
* Electronics: Basic Electronics for Scientists and Engineers by Eggleston. Accessible to anyone who has worked through the basics of electrodynamics.
* Particle Physics: Griffith's Introduction to Elementary Particles. Written by the same Griffith who gave us the Introduction to Electrodynamics and Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, this book is the perfect introduction to the fundamentals of particle physics and is a joy to work through!

## 弦理论

## book

* The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Boxed Set) and Feynman Lectures on Physics (Kindle Edition): Feynman's Lectures on Physics are essential readings for everyone interested in physics, and you'll find a copy on the bookshelf of every amateur physicist and professional physicist. These lectures are what got me into physics: my astronomy professor told me to read them and see if I liked physics - they changed my life!
* The Character of Physical Law by Richard Feynman: A brilliant, inspiring little book on the laws of nature.
* Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics by Bruce Schumm: the very best popular book about particle physics. I had the honor of working with Bruce Schumm on a search for supersymmetry at the ATLAS detector, and he has one of those brilliant minds that understands physics so deeply that he can explain it to anyone without resorting to speculation.
* The Particle Odyssey by Frank Close: another brilliant popular introduction to particle physics and its history, beautifully illustrated with amazing figures and photographs.
* Weinberg's The First Three Minutes: an account of the Big Bang by one of the most brilliant physicists of all time.
* 费曼物理学讲义
